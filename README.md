<h1>Python By Tushar</h1>

<h3>Why we use python?</h3>
<p>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. Since itâ€™s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.</p>

<h3>Python role in Data analysis and machine learning</h3>
<p>Python has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualisations, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyse data, and complete other data-related tasks.</p>
<p>Python can build various data visualisations, like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histogrammes, and 3D plots. Python also has many libraries that enable coders to write programs for data analysis and machine learning more quickly and efficiently, like TensorFlow and Keras.</p>
